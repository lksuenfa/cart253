HELP ORLANDO

Orlando, is hungry but blind. As a bat, he uses echolocation to navigate this environment. In this mini-game, you control Orlando using your cursor and your clicks activates his echolocation area. Find enough moths you satiate his appetite but remember that flying around looking for prey also requires energy. If his hunger level reaches 0, he'll die and his family will miss him a lot.
